//! Continuation: resuming a compilation from an artifact the caller already holds.
//!
//! A caller that has already produced part of a build — HIR it translated itself, or HIR it
//! rewrote — can ask for the rest of it rather than starting over. That is [`Start::At`], and
//! everything it needs is one provider installed for this request alone.
//!
//! # Why a provider, and not a branch in the driver
//!
//! Which frontend compiles a target is decided *inside* the assembler, from the target root's
//! extension, one target at a time. A seed is therefore not a phase the driver can skip: it is
//! a different answer to the question "who compiles the root target?", and the only place that
//! question is asked is the provider registry. So a seeded request installs a provider for the
//! selected target's extension through the request-scoped override
//! [`Pipeline::providers`](super::Pipeline::providers) already takes — the same mechanism the
//! standalone Rust entry point uses, appended last so it wins for that extension. There is no
//! second mechanism.
//!
//! # The seed replaces one target's front half, not the build
//!
//! Everything downstream of the seeded checkpoint is the same code an unseeded run takes, and
//! *which* code that is falls out of the checkpoint: a `hir.initial` seed still runs analysis,
//! the rewrites and codegen, while a `hir.transformed` seed has had the first two done to it and
//! runs codegen alone. Either way the phases are the shared backend's, they publish the same
//! checkpoints, and they hand assembly the same [`LoweredTarget`] — so a seeded run can itself
//! stop early, emit the same documents, and post-process its package the same way. None of that
//! is a special case here, and all of it is worth a test rather than an assumption.
//!
//! Everything *sideways* of it is unchanged too. The override displaces the registry's provider
//! for one extension, and that provider serves every target with that extension — not only the
//! root. [`SeedFrontend`] therefore wraps the frontend the registry would have used and
//! delegates every callback for a target the seed is not for, so a dependency that happens to
//! share the root's extension is compiled exactly as it would have been.
