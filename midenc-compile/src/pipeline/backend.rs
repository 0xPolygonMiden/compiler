//! The shared HIR backend, as a service frontends call.
//!
//! Frontends that produce HIR hand it here; the service runs analysis, rewrites, and
//! codegen, publishing a checkpoint after each. Frontends that produce Miden Assembly
//! directly do not call it.
//!
//! The three phases are also exposed individually — [`analyze`], [`apply_rewrites`] and
//! [`codegen`] — for callers that have no assembler and therefore no [`TargetContext`]: the
//! manifest Rust entry point's WebAssembly leg, and
//! `midenc-compile/tests/codegen_legalization.rs`. They run one phase and nothing else.
//!
//! No *stop policy* lives here, in either form. How far a build runs is the request's goal,
//! which the service answers at a [`CheckpointId`]; the `-C` stop flags are resolved into that
//! goal (see [`StopFlag`](super::StopFlag)) rather than checked at a phase boundary. A phase
//! called directly simply runs.

/// What lowering one target to Miden Assembly produced.
///
/// The [`sources`](LoweredTarget::sources) are what the assembler assembles; the other three
/// fields are what it cannot derive from them and the frontend must therefore keep until
/// [`Frontend::post_process`](super::Frontend::post_process):
///
/// - [`component`](LoweredTarget::component) carries the rodata segments that become the
///   assembled package's advice map. It is **not** optional, and dropping it is not a missing
///   section but a silent miscompile: the lowered code pushes each segment's commitment and
///   asks the advice provider for the data behind it, so a package assembled without the
///   advice map fails at run time, in the VM, with nothing in the build to point at.
/// - [`sections`](LoweredTarget::sections) carries the out-of-band payloads — the serialized
///   account-component metadata, the component's public WIT, and the note storage schema — that
///   become package sections.
/// - [`source_provenance`](LoweredTarget::source_provenance) is what the assembler hashes to
///   decide whether a cached build of this target is still current.
///
/// `post_process` is called with a *fresh* [`TargetContext`], so a frontend has to stash this
/// under [`TargetContext::target_key`] and read it back there; see
/// [`RustProjectFrontend`](super::frontends::rust::RustProjectFrontend), which keys its cargo
/// builds the same way. Keeping the stash in the frontend is deliberate: `hir_to_masm` is a
