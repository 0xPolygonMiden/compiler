//! The frontends for targets written in Rust.
//!
//! There are two, and the difference between them is how the WebAssembly is produced:
//!
//! - [`RUST_FRONTEND`] is the **project** frontend. Its targets are declared by a manifest, and
//!   building one means running `cargo`. This is what the registry holds under `rs`, because it
//!   is what a Rust *dependency* of any project is.
//! - [`RUST_STANDALONE_FRONTEND`] is the entry point for `midenc foo.rs`. One file is compiled
//!   to WebAssembly in this process — by `rustc` directly, or through a temporary Cargo project
//!   when the source declares dependencies.
//!
//! Past that point neither is Rust-specific at all: both hand their WebAssembly to
//! [`WasmFrontend::compile_wasm`](super::wasm::WasmFrontend), so both run
//! [`WASM_FRONTEND`](super::wasm::WASM_FRONTEND)'s route, publish its checkpoints and write its
//! inline `--emit` documents. That is why all three registrations declare the same route.
//!
//! Both claim the `rs` extension and no registry may hold both, which is exactly why the
//! standalone one is installed per request rather than registered; see
//! [`RUST_STANDALONE_FRONTEND`].

/// has to describe what the frontend actually publishes. It is consulted for the **selected root
/// target and nothing else**: `apply_stop_flags`, [`resolve_goal`](crate::pipeline::resolve_goal)

/// from the *root* target's extension, and the observer additionally renders only for
/// [`TargetRole::Root`](crate::pipeline::TargetRole). Nothing anywhere asks a route what a
/// dependency reaches.
///
/// That is what makes one registration able to describe [`RustProjectFrontend`] honestly even
/// though its two arms differ. As the root, a manifest-backed Rust target is built by running
/// `cargo` to WebAssembly and then handing that WebAssembly to
/// [`WasmFrontend::compile_wasm`](super::wasm::WasmFrontend) — so it publishes exactly what a
/// `.wasm` target publishes, because it is run by that code. As a *dependency* it publishes
/// nothing, and nothing asks it to.
///
/// The route is therefore [`WASM_FRONTEND`](super::wasm::WASM_FRONTEND)'s, with one
/// project-only checkpoint ahead of it: `dependencies.staged`, published before the root's
/// cargo build so `--stop-after=dependencies` stages a consumer's dependencies without
/// compiling the consumer. Held to that by `the_project_route_is_the_wasm_route`.
