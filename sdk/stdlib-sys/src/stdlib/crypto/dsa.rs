/// Verifies a signature against a public key and a message. The procedure gets as inputs the hash

/// returns.
///
/// Where `pk` is the hash of the public key and `msg` is the hash of the message. Both hashes are
/// expected to be computed using RPO hash function.
///
/// The procedure relies on the `adv.push_sig` decorator to retrieve the signature from the host.
/// The default host implementation assumes that the private-public key pair is loaded into the
/// advice provider, and uses it to generate the signature. However, for production grade
/// implementations, this functionality should be overridden to ensure more secure handling of
/// private keys.
