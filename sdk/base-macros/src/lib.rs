//! Module for Miden SDK macros
//!
//! ### How to use WIT generation.
//!
//! An account component is written in three parts:
//!
//! 1. A `#[component_storage]` struct declaring the component's `#[storage(...)]` fields.
//! 2. A `#[component]` `trait` declaring the component's API. The trait name yields the WIT
//!    interface name and its methods yield the exported functions.
//! 3. A `#[component]` `impl Trait for Storage` block providing the behavior.
//!
//! Add `#[export_type]` on every type that is used in an exported method signature.
//!
//! Example:
//! ```rust,ignore
//!
//! #[export_type]
//! pub struct StructA {
//!     pub foo: Word,
//!     pub asset: Asset,
//! }
//!
//! #[export_type]
//! pub struct StructB {
//!     pub bar: Felt,
//!     pub baz: Felt,
//! }
//!
//! #[component_storage]
//! struct MyAccountStorage;
//!
//! #[component]
//! trait MyAccount {
//!     fn foo(&self, a: StructA) -> StructB;
//! }
//!
//! #[component]
//! impl MyAccount for MyAccountStorage {
//!     fn foo(&self, a: StructA) -> StructB {
//!         ...
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Custom `#[export_type]` types referenced in component method signatures must be nameable from
//! the crate root (declared at, or `use`-imported into, the crate root).
//!

//! ### Escape hatch (disable WIT generation)
//!
//! in a small fraction of the cases where the WIT generation is not possible (think a type defined
//! only in an external WIT file) or not desirable the WIT generation can be disabled:
//!
//! To disable WIT interface generation:
//! - Don't use the `#[component]` trait/impl macros; keep `#[component_storage]` on the storage
//!   struct;
//!
//! To use manually crafted WIT interface:
//! - Put the WIT file in the `wit` folder;
//! - call `miden::generate!();` and `bindings::export!(MyAccountStorage);`
//! - implement `impl Guest for MyAccountStorage`;

/// Apply `#[component]` to a `trait` (the API, and the source of the WIT interface — its name yields
/// the interface name) and to the matching `impl Trait for Storage` block (the behavior). Storage
/// lives on a separate `#[component_storage]` struct.
///
/// Both the trait and the implementation block must carry `#[component]`, and the storage struct
/// must carry `#[component_storage]`. A missing trait annotation surfaces as a missing-item error
/// naming `__MIDEN_COMPONENT_TRAIT_MARKER`, and a missing storage annotation as one naming
/// `__MIDEN_COMPONENT_STORAGE_MARKER` — hidden constants those expansions inject and the
/// implementation expansion checks for.
///
/// **NOTE:** Mark each type used in an exported method with the `#[export_type]` attribute macro.
///
/// # Sibling component calls
///
/// An account may be deployed with several components. To call the other ("sibling") components
/// of the same account, list them on the component trait as `package::Interface` references — the
/// Rust-style Miden package name (replace `-` with `_`) followed by the sibling's exported WIT
/// interface in UpperCamelCase. Each reference generates a `pub trait` named after the interface
/// whose default methods call the sibling through the Wasm component-model boundary (a
/// cross-context `call`, the same mechanism note scripts use to call the account). The generated
/// traits attach to `#[component_storage]` structs automatically, and may be declared as
/// supertraits of the component trait to make the dependency part of its API:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use miden::{component, component_storage, native_account::NativeAccount, Asset};
///
/// #[component_storage]
/// struct MyComponentStorage;
///
/// // Generates `trait Pausable` and `trait CounterContract` with default methods that
/// // call the sibling components deployed on the same account.
/// #[component(pausable::Pausable, counter_contract::CounterContract)]
/// trait MyComponent: NativeAccount + Pausable + CounterContract {
///     fn receive_asset(&mut self, asset: Asset);

/// #[component] // the implementation block takes no arguments
/// impl MyComponent for MyComponentStorage {

/// the wrapper struct must be named differently from every referenced interface.
///
/// ```rust,ignore

/// primer on worlds see [here][worlds].
///
/// [WIT]: https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html
/// [worlds]: https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/worlds.html
///
/// For documentation on each option, see below.
///
/// ## Exploring generated bindings
///
/// Once bindings have been generated they can be explored via a number of means
/// to see what was generated:
///
/// * Using `cargo doc` should render all of the generated bindings in addition
///   to the original comments in the WIT format itself.
/// * If your IDE supports `rust-analyzer` code completion should be available
///   to explore and see types.
///
/// ## Namespacing
///
/// The generated bindings are put in `bindings` module.
/// In WIT, worlds can import and export `interface`s, functions, and types. Each
/// `interface` can either be "anonymous" and only named within the context of a
/// `world` or it can have a "package ID" associated with it. Names in Rust take
/// into account all the names associated with a WIT `interface`. For example
/// the package ID `foo:bar/baz` would create a `mod foo` which contains a `mod
/// bar` which contains a `mod baz`.
///
/// WIT imports and exports are additionally separated into their own
/// namespaces. Imports are generated at the level of the `generate!` macro
/// where exports are generated under an `exports` namespace.
///
/// ## Exports: The `export!` macro
///
/// Components are created by having exported WebAssembly functions with
/// specific names, and these functions are not created when `generate!` is
/// invoked. Instead these functions are created afterwards once you've defined
/// your own type an implemented the various `trait`s for it. The
/// `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` functions that will become the component are created
/// with the generated `export!` macro.
///
/// Each call to `generate!` will itself generate a macro called `export!`.
/// The macro's first argument is the name of a type that implements the traits
/// generated:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use miden::generate;
///
/// generate!({
///     inline: r#"
///         package my:test;
///
///         world my-world {
/// #           export hello: func();
///             // ...
///         }
///     "#,
/// });
///
/// struct MyComponent;
///
/// impl Guest for MyComponent {
/// #   fn hello() {}
///     // ...
/// }
///
/// export!(MyComponent);
/// #
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// This argument is a Rust type which implements the `Guest` traits generated
/// by `generate!`. Note that all `Guest` traits must be implemented for the
/// type provided or an error will be generated.
///
/// ## Options to `generate!`
///
/// The full list of options that can be passed to the `generate!` macro are as
/// follows. Note that there are no required options, they all have default
/// values.
///
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use miden::generate;
/// # macro_rules! generate { ($($t:tt)*) => () }
///
/// generate!({
///     // Enables passing "inline WIT". If specified this is the default
///     // package that a world is selected from. Any dependencies that this
///     // inline WIT refers to must be defined in the `path` option above.
///     //
///     // By default this is not specified.
///     inline: "
///         world my-world {
///             import wasi:cli/imports;
///
///             export my-run: func()
///         }
///     ",
///
///     // When generating bindings for interfaces that are not defined in the
///     // same package as `world`, this option can be used to either generate
///     // those bindings or point to already generated bindings.
///     // For example, if your world refers to WASI types then the `wasi` crate
///     // already has generated bindings for all WASI types and structures. In this
///     // situation the key `with` here can be used to use those types
///     // elsewhere rather than regenerating types.
///     // If for example your world refers to some type and you want to use
///     // your own custom implementation of that type then you can specify
///     // that here as well. There is a requirement on the remapped (custom)
///     // type to have the same internal structure and identical to what would
///     // wit-bindgen generate (including alignment, etc.), since
///     // lifting/lowering uses its fields directly.
///     //
///     // If, however, your world refers to interfaces for which you don't have
///     // already generated bindings then you can use the special `generate` value
///     // to have those bindings generated.
///     //
///     // The `with` key here works for interfaces and individual types.
///     //
///     // When an interface or type is specified here no bindings will be
///     // generated at all. It's assumed bindings are fully generated
///     // somewhere else. This is an indicator that any further references to types
///     // defined in these interfaces should use the upstream paths specified
///     // here instead.
///     //
///     // Any unused keys in this map are considered an error.
///     with: {
///         "wasi:io/poll": wasi::io::poll,
