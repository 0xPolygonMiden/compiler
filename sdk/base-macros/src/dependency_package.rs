//! Locating and reading compiled Miden dependency packages (`.masp`) at macro-expansion time.
//!
//! A Miden path dependency is consumed through its compiled package: the `.masp` carries both the
//! dependency's embedded component WIT (read here) and its procedure roots (read by [`crate::fpi`]).
//!
//! Every dependency package comes from the build-owned package cache named by
//! `MIDENC_PACKAGE_CACHE`. A midenc-driven build compiles the dependencies, publishes them into
//! its per-build cache, and exports the variable to its nested cargo builds; the contract
//! `build.rs` does the same for plain `cargo build`/`cargo check` and IDE analysis through a
//! stable exported directory. The macros
//! never search the filesystem for packages themselves — the one exception is a dependency whose
//! manifest path names a `.masp` file directly, which is read from that explicit location.
