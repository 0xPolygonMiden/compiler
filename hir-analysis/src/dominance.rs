///
/// Dominance frontiers are useful in the construction of SSA form, as well as identifying control
/// dependent dataflow (for example, a variable in a program that has a different value depending
/// on what branch of an `if` statement is taken).
///
/// A dominance frontier can also be computed for a set of blocks, by taking the union of the
/// dominance frontiers of each block in the set.
///
/// An iterated dominance frontier is given by computing the dominance frontier for some set `X`,
/// i.e. `DF(X)`, then computing the dominance frontier on that, i.e. `DF(DF(X))`, taking the union
/// of the results, and repeating this process until fixpoint is reached. This is often represented
/// in literature as `DF+(X)`.
///
/// Iterated dominance frontiers are of particular usefulness to us, because they correspond to the
/// set of blocks in which we need to place phi nodes for some variable, in order to properly handle
/// control dependent dataflow for that variable.
///
/// Consider the following example (not in SSA form):
///
///
/// ```text,ignore
/// block0(x):
///   v = 0
///   cond_br x, block1, block2
///
/// block1():
///   v = 1
///   br block3
///
/// block2():
///   v = 2
///   br block3
///
/// block3:
///   ret v
/// ```
///
/// In this example, we have a variable, `v`, which is assigned new values later in the program
/// depending on which path through the program is taken. To transform this program into SSA form,
/// we take the set `V`, containing all of the assignments to `v`, and compute `DF+(V)`. Given
/// the program above, that would give us the set `{block3}`:
///
/// * The dominance frontier of the assignment in `block0` is empty, because `block0` strictly
/// dominates all other blocks in the program.
/// * The dominance frontier of the assignment in `block1` contains `block3`, because `block1`
/// dominates a predecessor of `block3` (itself), but does not strictly dominate that predecessor,
/// because a node cannot strictly dominate itself.
/// * The dominance frontier of the assignment in `block2` contains `block3`, for the same reasons
/// as `block1`.
/// * The dominance frontier of `block3` is empty, because it has no successors and thus cannot
/// dominate any other blocks.
/// * The union of all the dominance frontiers is simply `{block3}`
///
/// So this tells us that we need to place a phi node (a block parameter) at `block3`, and rewrite
/// all uses of `v` strictly dominated by the phi node to use the value associated with the phi
/// instead. In every predecessor of `block3`, we must pass `v` as a new block argument. Lastly, to
/// obtain SSA form, we rewrite assignments to `v` as defining new variables instead, and walk up
/// the dominance tree from each use of `v` until we find the nearest dominating definition for that
/// use, and rewrite the usage of `v` to use the value produced by that definition. Performing these
/// steps gives us the following program:
///
/// ```text,ignore
/// block0(x):
///   v0 = 0
///   cond_br x, block1, block2
///
/// block1():
///   v2 = 1
///   br block3(v2)
///
/// block2():
///   v3 = 2
///   br block3(v3)
///
/// block3(v1):
///   ret v1
/// ```
///
/// This program is in SSA form, and the dataflow for `v` is now explicit. An interesting
/// consequence of the transformation we performed, is that we are able to trivially recognize
/// that the definition of `v` in `block0` is unused, allowing us to eliminate it entirely.
