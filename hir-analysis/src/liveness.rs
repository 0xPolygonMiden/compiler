/// This data structure is the result of computing liveness information over the

/// liveness that is ideally suited to optimal register allocation over programs
/// in SSA form, as described in _Register Spilling and Live-Range Splitting for
/// SSA-Form Programs_, by Matthias Braun and Sebastian Hack.
///
/// In short, rather than simply tracking what values are live at a particular
/// program point, we instead track the global next-use distance for all values
/// which are live at a given program point. Just like the more typical liveness
/// analysis, the next-use analysis computes next-use distances for a block by
/// taking the next-use distances at the exit of the block, and working backwards
/// to compute the next-use distances at the entry of the block. When computing
/// the next-use distances at the exit of a block with multiple successors, the
/// join function takes the minimum next-use distances of all variables live across
/// some edge.
///
/// By default, variables introduced by an instruction (i.e. their definition) are
/// assigned the next-use distance at the next instruction (or the block exit). If
/// no use of the variable has been observed, it is assigned a next-use distance of
/// infinity (here represented as `u32::MAX`). Each time we step backwards up through
/// the block, we increment the distance of all values observed so far by 1. If we
/// encounter a use of a variable at the current instruction, its next-use distance
/// is set to 0.
///
/// When we calculate the next-use distances for the exit of a block, the set is
/// initialized by taking the join of the next-use distances at the entry of all
/// successors of that block, or the empty set if there are no successors. However,
/// if the current block is inside a loop, and any successor is outside that loop,
/// then all next-use distances obtained from that successor are incremented by a
/// large constant (1000 in our case).
///
/// The algorithm follows the standard dataflow analysis approach of working until
/// a fixpoint is reached. We start by visiting the control flow graph in reverse
/// postorder, and revisit any blocks whose results change since the last time we
/// saw that block.
///
/// The resulting data structure is ideal for register allocation, but the real benefit
/// is that it allows us to be smart about how we spill values, since it can tell us
/// how "hot" a value is, allowing us to prioritize such values over those which may
/// not be used for awhile.
