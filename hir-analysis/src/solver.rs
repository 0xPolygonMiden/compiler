    /// A state of a data-flow analysis is required to be a valid instance of one of the following:
    ///
    /// * A join-semilattice (forward data-flow analysis)
    /// * A meet-semilattice (backward data-flow analysis)
    /// * A lattice (i.e. both a join- and meet- semilattice)
    ///
    /// Specifically this requires the following properties to be upheld:
    ///
    /// * The analysis state has a most-minimal value (i.e. under-specified, unknown, bottom)
    /// * The analysis state has a most-maximal value (i.e. over-specified, conflict, top)
    /// * The _join_ of two instances of the analysis state, produces a new state which is either
    ///   equal to the old states, or the least upper bound of the two states.
    /// * The _meet_ of two instances of the analysis state, produces a new state which is either
    ///   equal to the old states, or the greatest lower bound  of the two states.
    /// * The _join_ and _meet_ operations must be commutative, associative, and idempotent
    ///
    /// With this in mind, it becomes obvious how fixpoint is a guarantee:
    ///
    /// * Each change (via meet or join) to the analysis state, by definition, produces a new state
    ///   which is either unchanged, or has a value which is the greatest lower (or least upper)
    ///   bound of the input states. Thus changes always move in a single direction, either most-
    ///   maximal (or most-minimal).
    /// * As a result, an analysis that is re-enqueued due to a changed analysis state, is
    ///   guaranteed to observe a new, unique state. No further changes are possible after a state
    ///   reaches its most-maximal (or most-minimal) representation.

    /// and upper bound for, and bounds can be further refined as analysis proceeds, potentially all
    /// the way until it is determined that the range of a value is fixed to a single integral
