/// This analysis is responsible for simulating the state of the operand stack at each program
/// point, taking into account the results of liveness analysis, and computing whether or not to
/// insert spills/reloads of values which would cause the operand stack depth to exceed 16 elements,
/// the maximum addressable depth.
///
/// The algorithm here is based on the paper [_Register Spilling and Live-Range Splitting for
/// SSA-form Programs_ by Matthias Braun and Sebastian Hack](https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/braun09cc.pdf),
/// which also happens to describe the algorithm we based our liveness analysis on. While the broad
/// strokes are the same, various modifications/tweaks to the algorithm they describe are needed in
/// order to be suitable for our use case. In particular, we must distinguish between the SSA values
/// which uniquely identify each operand, from the raw elements on the operand stack which represent
/// those values. The need for spills is determined solely on the low-level operand stack
/// representation, _not_ the number of live SSA values (although there can be a correspondence in
/// cases where each SSA value has an effective size of 1 stack element). As this is a type-
/// sensitive analysis, it differs from the algorithm in the paper, which is based on an assumption
/// that all operands are machine-word sized, and thus each value only requires a single register to
/// hold.
///
/// Despite these differences, the overall approach is effectively identical. We still are largely
/// concerned with the SSA values, the primary difference being that we are computing spills based
/// on the raw operand stack state, rather than virtual register pressure as described in the paper.
/// As a result, the number of spills needed at a given program point are not necessarily 1:1, as
/// it may be necessary to spill multiple values in order to free sufficient capacity on the operand
/// stack to hold the required operands; or conversely, we may evict operands that free up more
/// operand stack space than is strictly needed due to the size of those values.
///
/// The general algorithm, once liveness has been computed (see [LivenessAnalysis] for more
/// details), can be summarized as follows:
///
/// In reverse CFG postorder, visit each block B, and:
///
/// 1. Determine initialization of W at entry to B (W^entry). W is the set of operands on the
///    operand stack. From this we are able to determine what, if any, actions are required to
///    keep |W| <= K where K is the maximum allowed operand stack depth.
///
/// 2. Determine initialization of S at entry to B (S^entry). S is the set of values which have
///    been spilled up to that point in the program. We can use S to determine whether or not
///    to actually emit a spill instruction when a spill is necessary, as due to the SSA form of
///    the program, every value has a single definition, so we need only emit a spill for a given
///    value once.
///
/// 3. For each predecessor P of B, determine what, if any, spills and/or reloads are needed to
///    ensure that W and S are consistent regardless of what path is taken to reach B, and that
///    |W| <= K. Depending on whether P has multiple successors, it may be necessary to split the
///    edge between P and B, so that the emitted spills/reloads only apply along that edge.
///
/// 4. Perform the MIN algorithm on B, which is used to determine spill/reloads at each instruction
///    in the block. MIN is designed to make optimal decisions about what to spill, so as to
///    minimize the number of spill/reload-related instructions executed by any given program
///    execution trace. It does this by using the next-use distance associated with values in W,
///    which is computed as part of our liveness analysis. Unlike traditional liveness analysis
///    which only tracks what is live at a given program point, next-use distances not only tell
///    you whether a value is live or dead, but how far away the next use of that value is. MIN
///    uses this information to select spill candidates from W furthest away from the current
///    instruction; and on top of this we also add an additional heuristic based on the size of
///    each candidate as represented on the operand stack. Given two values with equal next-use
///    distances, the largest candidates are spilled first, allowing us to free more operand stack
///    space with fewer spills.
///
/// The MIN algorithm works as follows:
///
/// 1. Starting at the top of the block, B, W is initialized with the set W^entry(B), and S with
///    S^entry(B)
///
/// 2. For each instruction, I, in the block, update W and S according to the needs of I, while
///    attempting to preserve as many live values in W as possible. Each instruction fundamentally
///    requires that: On entry, W contains all the operands of I; on exit, W contains all of the
///    results of I; and that at all times, |W| <= K. This means that we may need to reload operands
///    of I that are not in W (because they were spilled), and we may need to spill values from W to
///    ensure that the stack depth <= K. The specific effects for I are computed as follows:
///    a. All operands of I not in W, must be reloaded in front of I, thus adding them to W.
///    This is also one means by which values are added to S, as by definition a reload implies that
///    the value must have been spilled, or it would still be in W. Thus, when we emit reloads, we
///    also ensure that the reloaded value is added to S.
///    b. If a reload would cause |W| to exceed K, we must select values in W to spill. Candidates
///    are selected from the set of values in W which are not operands of I, prioritized first by
///    greatest next-use distance, then by stack consumption, as determined by the representation of
///    the value type on the operand stack.
///    c. By definition, none of I's results can be in W directly in front of I, so we must always
///    ensure that W has sufficient capacity to hold all of I's results. The analysis of sufficient
///    capacity is somewhat subtle:
///       - Any of I's operands that are live-at I, but _not_ live-after I, do _not_ count towards
///         the operand stack usage when calculating available capacity for the results. This is
///         because those operands will be consumed, and their space can be re-used for results.
///       - Any of I's operands that are live-after I, however, _do_ count towards the stack usage
///       - If W still has insufficient capacity for all the results, we must select candidates
///         to spill. Candidates are the set of values in W which are either not operands of I,
///         or are operands of I which are live-after I. Selection criteria is the same as before.
///
///    d. Operands of I which are _not_ live-after I, are removed from W on exit from I, thus W
///    reflects only those values which are live at the current program point.
///    e. Lastly, when we select a value to be spilled, we only emit spill instructions for those
///    values which are not yet in S, i.e. they have not yet been spilled; and which have a finite
///    next-use distance, i.e. the value is still live. If a value to be spilled _is_ in S and/or is
///    unused after that point in the program, we can elide the spill entirely.
///
/// What we've described above represents both the analysis itself, as well as the effects of
/// applying that analysis to the actual control flow graph of the function. However, doing so
/// introduces a problem that must be addressed: SSA-form programs can only have a single definition
/// of each value, but by introducing spills (and consequently, reloads of the spilled values), we
/// have introduced new definitions of those values - each reload constitutes a new definition.
/// As a result, our program is no longer in SSA form, and we must restore that property in order
/// to proceed with compilation.
///
/// **NOTE:** The way that we represent reloads doesn't _literally_ introduce multiple definitions
/// of a given [Value], our IR does not permit representing that. Instead, we represent reloads as
/// an instruction which takes the spilled SSA value we want to reload as an argument, and produces
/// a new SSA value representing the reloaded spill. As a result of this representation, our program
/// always remains technically in SSA form, but the essence of the problem remains the same: When a
/// value is spilled, its live range is terminated; a reload effectively brings the spilled value
/// back to life, starting a new live range. Thus references to the spilled value which are now
/// dominated by a reload in the control flow graph, are no longer semantically correct - they must
/// be rewritten to reference the nearest dominating definition.
///
/// Restoring SSA form is not the responsibility of this analysis, however I will briefly describe
/// the method here, while you have the context at hand. The obvious assumption would be that we
/// simply treat each reload as a new SSA value, and update any uses of the original value with the
/// nearest dominating definition. The way we represent reloads in HIR already does the first step
/// for us, however there is a subtle problem with the second part: join points in the control flow
/// graph. Consider the following:
///
/// ```text,ignore
/// (block 0 (param v0) (param v1)
///   (cond_br v1 (block 1) (block 2)))
///
/// (block 1
///   (spill v0)
///   ...
///   (let v2 (reload v0)) ; here we've assigned the reload of v0 a new SSA value
///   (br (block 3)))
///
/// (block 2
///   ...
///   (br (block 3)))
///
/// (block 3
///    (ret v2)) ; here we've updated a v0 reference to the nearest definition
/// ```
///
/// Above, control flow branches in one of two directions from the entry block, and along one of
/// those branches `v0` is spilled and later reloaded. Control flow joins again in the final block
/// where `v0` is returned. We attempted to restore the program to SSA form as described above,
/// first by assigning reloads a new SSA value, then by finding all uses of the spilled value and
/// rewriting those uses to reference the nearest dominating definition.
///
/// Because the use of `v0` in block 3 is dominated by the reload in block 1, it is rewritten to
/// reference `v2` instead. The problem with that is obvious - the reload in block 1 does not
/// _strictly_ dominate the use in block 3, i.e. there are paths through the function which can
/// reach block 3 without passing through block 1 first, and `v2` will be undefined along those
/// paths!
///
/// However this problem also has an obvious solution: introduce a new block parameter in block 3
/// to represent the appropriate definition of `v0` that applies based on the predecessor used to
/// reach block 3. This ensures that the use in block 3 is strictly dominated by an appropriate
/// definition.
///
/// So now that we've understood the problem with the naive approach, and the essence of the
/// solution to that particular problem, we can walk through the generalized solution that can be
/// used to reconstruct SSA form for any program we can represent in our IR.
///
/// 1. Given the set of spilled values, S, visit the dominance tree in postorder (bottom-up)
/// 2. In each block, working towards the start of the block from the end, visit each instruction
///    until one of the following occurs:
///    a. We find a use of a value in S. We append the use to the list of other uses of that value
///    which are awaiting a rewrite while we search for the nearest dominating definition.
///    b. We find a reload of a value in S. This reload is, by construction, the nearest dominating
///    definition for all uses of the reloaded value that we have found so far. We rewrite all of
///    those uses to reference the reloaded value, and remove them from the list.
///    c. We find the original definition of a value in S. This is similar to what happens when we
///    find a reload, except no rewrite is needed, so we simply remove all pending uses of that
///    value from the list.
///    d. We reach the top of the block. Note that block parameters are treated as definitions, so
///    those are handled first as described in the previous point. However, an additional step is
///    required here: If the current block is in the iterated dominance frontier for S, i.e. for any
///    value in S, the current block is in the dominance frontier of the original definition of that
///    value - then for each such value for which we have found at least one use, we must add a new
///    block parameter representing that value; rewrite all uses we have found so far to use the
///    block parameter instead; remove those uses from the list; and lastly, rewrite the branch
///    instruction in each predecessor to pass the value as a new block argument when branching to
///    the current block.
/// 3. When we start processing a block, the union of the set of unresolved uses found in each
///    successor, forms the initial state of that set for the current block. If a block has no
///    successors, then the set is initially empty. This is how we propagate uses up the dominance
///    tree until we find an appropriate definition. Since we ensure that block parameters are added
///    along the dominance frontier for each spilled value, we guarantee that the first definition
///    we reach always strictly dominates the uses we have propagated to that point.
///
/// NOTE: A nice side effect of this algorithm is that any reloads we reach for which we have
/// no uses, are dead and can be eliminated. Similarly, a reload we never reach must also be
/// dead code - but in practice that won't happen, since we do not visit unreachable blocks
/// during the spill analysis anyway.
