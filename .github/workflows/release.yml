# Runs `release-plz release` only after the release PR (starts with `release-plz-`)
# is merged to the next branch. See `release_always = false` in `release-plz.toml`
# Publishes any unpublished crates when.
# Does nothing if all crates are already published (i.e. have their versions on crates.io).
# Does not create/update release PRs.
# The crate version bumping and changelog generation is done via the `release-plz update` CLI command.
# Then manually create a release PR(starts with `release-plz-`) with the proposed changes and
# when the PR is merged this action will publish the crates.
# See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.
