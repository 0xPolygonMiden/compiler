/// An [Interface] is a modular abstraction operation, i.e. it is designed to model groups of
/// related functionality meant to be produced/consumed together.
///
/// An [Interface] itself represents a shared-nothing boundary, i.e. the functionality it exports
/// uses the Canonical ABI of the Wasm Component Model. However, it is possible for a
/// [super::Component] to export multiple interfaces which are implemented within the same
/// shared-everything boundary. Even when that is the case, calls to any [Interface] export from
/// within that boundary, will still be treated as crossing a shared-nothing boundary. In this way,
/// components can both define and re-export interfaces from other components, without callers
/// needing to know where the actual definition is provided from.
///
/// Interfaces correspond to component _instances_ exported from a component _definition_ in the
/// Wasm Component Model. This means that they are almost identical concepts, however we distinguish
/// between [super::Component] and [Interface] in the IR to better model the relationships between
/// these concepts, as well as to draw a connection to interfaces in WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types).
///
/// ## Contents
///
/// Interfaces may only contain [builtin::Function] items, and may only _export_ functions with the
/// `CanonLift` calling convention. It is expected that these functions will rely on implementation
/// details defined in a sibling [builtin::Module], though that is not strictly required.
///
/// Note: This restriction is a convention rather than a verified rule. While the symbol table does
/// not explicitly reject other symbol types, [builtin::FunctionAlias] is generally reserved for
/// core modules (e.g. Wasm `N:1` exports) and does not appear in interfaces.
