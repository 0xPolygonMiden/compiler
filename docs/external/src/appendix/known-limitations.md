# Known limitations

:::tip

See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/issues) for information
on known bugs. This document focuses on missing/incomplete features, rather than bugs.

:::

The compiler is still in its early stages of development, so there are various features that are
unimplemented, or only partially implemented, and the test suite is still limited in scope, so
we are still finding bugs on a regular basis. We are rapidly improving this situation, but it is
important to be aware of this when using the compiler.

The features discussed below are broken up into sections, to make them easier to navigate and
reference.

## Rust language support

### Floating point types

- Status: **Unsupported**
- Tracking Issue: N/A
- Release Milestone: N/A

In order to represent `Felt` "natively" in Rust, we were forced to piggy-back on the `f32` type,
which is propagated through to WebAssembly, and allows us to handle those values specially.

As a result, floating-point types in Rust are not supported at all. Any attempt to use them will
result in a compilation error. We considered this a fair design tradeoff, as floating point math
is unused/rare in the context in which Miden is used, in comparison to fixed-point or field
arithmetic. In addition, implementing floating-point operations in software on the Miden VM would
be extraordinarily expensive, which generally works against the purpose of using floats in the
first place.

At this point in time, we have no plans to support floats, but this may change if we are able to
find a better/more natural representation for `Felt` in WebAssembly.

### Function call indirection

- Status: **Partially implemented**
- Tracking Issue: [#32](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/issues/32)

This feature corresponds to `call_indirect` in WebAssembly, and is associated with Rust features
such as function pointers, trait objects (which use indirection to call trait methods), and
closures.

The compiler lowers each locally-defined Wasm `funcref` table through which a `call_indirect`
dispatches (tables that are never dispatched through, which Wasm toolchains routinely emit, are
ignored) to a word-aligned region of linear memory holding two words per table slot: the MAST
root digest of the referenced function, paired with a tag that identifies the function's
signature (an all-zero slot — zero digest, tag 0 — denotes a null entry). The region is
populated at program startup by the component initialization procedure using `procref`, and
`call_indirect` dispatches through it with `dynexec` (i.e. in the caller's memory context) after
two deterministic runtime checks that mirror Wasm's `call_indirect` semantics:

- a bounds check on the table index, which traps with an "indirect call: function table index
  out of bounds" assertion failure;
- a signature check comparing the slot's tag with the signature expected at the call site,
  which traps with an "indirect call: callee signature mismatch or null function reference"
  assertion failure. Null slots hold the reserved tag 0, so this check also produces Wasm's
  uninitialized-element trap.

The following limitations remain:

- The signature and null checks share one assertion message (see above), rather than trapping
  with Wasm's distinct "indirect call type mismatch" and "uninitialized element" traps.
- Unlike a Wasm table, which lives outside the program's addressable memory, the lowered table
  is a region of ordinary linear memory: a wild out-of-bounds write (only possible through
  code whose behavior is already undefined) can overwrite a slot and its tag, bypassing the
  signature check. A corrupted slot can still never escape the program: `dynexec` resolves the
  slot's first word as a MAST root digest, so it either matches a procedure already compiled
  into the program or fails execution.
- Imported tables, non-`funcref` tables, element segments with `global.get`-relative offsets, the
  table mutation ops (`table.set`, `table.get`, `table.grow`, etc.), `ref.func`/`ref.null` as
  function body instructions, and `return_call_indirect` are unsupported, and produce a
  compile-time error.
- The callee arguments plus the table index must fit in Miden's 16-element operand stack window,
  so indirect callee signatures are limited to 15 field elements worth of arguments.
- A `funcref` table entry naming a function the compiler lowers to an inlined operation — the
  linker stubs for intrinsics such as `intrinsics::felt::add`, whose Wasm body is a single
  `unreachable` — is rejected: the stub has no procedure body whose MAST root a slot could
  hold. Calling such a function directly is supported; only taking its address is not.
- For a linker stub naming an intrinsic the compiler lowers to a MASM procedure, the stub's
  declared Wasm signature is taken at face value: it is what calls are emitted from and what the
  stub's table entries are tagged with, and it is never checked against the signature the
  intrinsic actually has. Declaring such a stub with the wrong signature is a program error the
  compiler does not diagnose: a wrong parameter or result type produces a mismatched stack
  contract at run time, and a wrong number of parameters fails late in compilation rather than
  as a diagnostic.

### Miden SDK

- Status: **Incomplete**
- Tracking Issue: [#159](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/issues/159) and [#158](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/issues/158)
- Release Milestone: [Beta 1](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/milestone/4)

The Miden SDK for Rust, is a Rust crate that provides the implementation of native Miden types, as
well as bindings to the Miden standard library and transaction kernel APIs.

Currently, only a very limited subset of the API surface has had bindings implemented. This means
that there is a fair amount of native Miden functionality that is not yet available from Rust. We
will be expanding the SDK rapidly over the next few weeks and months, but for the time being, if
you encounter a missing API that you need, let us know, so we can ensure it is prioritized above
APIs which are lesser used.

### Rust/Miden FFI (foreign function interface) and interop

- Status: **Internal Use Only**
- Tracking Issue: [#304](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/issues/304)
- Release Milestone: TBD

While the compiler has functionality to link against native Miden Assembly libraries, binding
against procedures exported from those libraries from Rust can require glue code to be emitted
by the compiler in some cases, and the set of procedures for which this is done is currently
restricted to a hardcoded whitelist of known Miden procedures.

This affects any procedure which returns a type larger than `u32` (excluding `Felt`, which for
this purpose has the same size). For example, returning a Miden `Word` from a procedure, a common
return type, is not compatible with Rust's ABI - it will attempt to generate code which allocates
stack space in the caller, which it expects the callee to write to, inserting a new parameter at
the start of the parameter list, and expecting nothing to be returned by value. The compiler handles
situations like these using a set of ABI "transformation strategies", which lift/lower differences
between the Rust and Miden ABIs at call boundaries.

To expose the FFI machinery for use with any Miden procedure, we need type signatures for those
procedures at a minimum, and in some cases we may require details of the calling convention/ABI.
This metadata does not currently exist, but is on the roadmap for inclusion into Miden Assembly
and Miden packaging. Once present, we can open up the FFI for general use.

## Core Miden functionality

### Dynamic procedure invocation

- Status: **Partially implemented**
- Tracking Issue: [#32](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/issues/32)

This is the mechanism behind [Function Call Indirection](#function-call-indirection) described
above. Same-context indirect calls are lowered to `dynexec`: the VM pops a word-aligned memory
address from the operand stack, reads the word at that address as the MAST root of the callee,
and transfers control to it, so the callee observes its arguments in the normal order with no
extra stack fixup (older VM versions kept the callee hash on the operand stack, which would have
required per-callee stubs; that design is obsolete).

Cross-context indirect calls via `dyncall` are not lowered yet; they additionally depend on
[Cross-Context Procedure Invocation](#cross-context-procedure-invocation).

### Cross-context procedure invocation

- Status: **Unimplemented**
- Tracking Issue: [#303](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/issues/303)
- Release Milestone: [Beta 2](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/milestone/5)

This is required in order to support representing Miden accounts and note scripts in Rust, and
compilation to Miden Assembly.

Currently, you can write code in Rust that is very close to how accounts and note scripts will
look like in the language, but it is not possible to actually implement either of those in Rust
today. The reasons for this are covered in depth in the tracking issue linked above, but to
briefly summarize, the primary issue has to do with the fact that Rust programs are compiled
for a "shared-everything" environment, i.e. you can pass references to memory from caller to
callee, write to caller memory from the callee, etc. In Miden however, contexts are "shared-nothing"
units of isolation, and thus cross-context operations, such as performing a `call` from a note script
to a method on an account, are not compatible with the usual calling conventions used by Rust and
LLVM.

The solution to this relies on compiling the Rust code for the `wasm32-wasip2` target, which emits
a new kind of WebAssembly module, known as a _component_. These components adhere to the rules of
the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/). Of primary
interest to us, is the fact that components in this model are "shared-nothing", and the ABI used to
communicate across component boundaries, is specially designed to enforce shared-nothing semantics
on caller and callee. In addition to compiling for a specific Wasm target, we also rely on some
additional tooling for describing component interfaces, types, and generating Rust bindings for
those descriptions, to ensure that calls across the boundary remain opaque, even to the linker,
which ensures that the assumptions of the caller and callee with regard to what address space they
operate in are preserved (i.e. a callee can never be inlined into the caller, and thus end up
executing in the caller's context rather than the expected callee context).

This is one of our top priorities, as it is critical to be able to use Rust to compile code for
the Miden rollup, but it is also the most complex feature on our roadmap, hence why it is scheduled
for our Beta 2 milestone, rather than Beta 1 (the next release), as it depends on multiple other
subfeatures being implemented first.

## Packaging

### Package format

- Status: **Experimental**
- Tracking Issue: [#121](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/issues/121)
- Release Milestone: [Beta 1](https://github.com/0xMiden/compiler/milestone/4)

This feature represents the ability to compile and distribute a single artifact that contains
the compiled MAST, and all required and optional metadata to make linking against, and executing
packages as convenient as a dynamic library or executable.

The compiler currently produces, by default, an experimental implementation of a package format
that meets the minimum requirements to support libraries and programs compiled from Rust:

- Name and semantic version information
- Content digest
- The compiled MAST and metadata about the procedures exported from it
- Read-only data segments and their hashes (if needed by the program, used to load data into the
  advice provider when a program is loaded, and to write those segments into linear memory when the
  program starts)
- Dependency information (optional, specifies what libraries were linked against during compilation)
- Debug information (optional)

Use a compatible `miden-debug` executable to load and execute `.masp` packages, including their
metadata and dependencies. The compiler's `midenc` executable compiles artifacts; execution and
debugging are provided by the separate debugger.

```shell
miden-debug program.masp --inputs inputs.toml
```

See [Debugging programs](../guides/debugger.md) for installation, interactive use, and command-script
execution. Keep the debugger's package and VM versions compatible with the compiler that produced
the artifact; a package produced by another toolchain version may require that toolchain's debugger.
