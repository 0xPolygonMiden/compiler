# Compiler Architecture

This is an index of various design documents for the compiler and its components. Some of these
are planned topics, and some have documentation that hasn't been polished up yet. We'll slowly
start to flesh out the documentation in this section as the compiler matures.

* Data Layout
* Inline Assembly
