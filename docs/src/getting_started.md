# Getting Started

This book attempts to provide a thorough reference for compiling to Miden Assembly 
using one or more components of the Miden compiler suite. Which components you use, 
and how you use them is likely to differ depending on the project, but we've tried
to provide good coverage regardless. 

There is a set of guides which are focused on documenting the workflows for specific 
use cases that we wish to ensure are well supported, or have encountered so far, but
if you feel there is anything missing, feel free to open an issue and we will try to
address the missing docs as soon as possible!

## Installation

There are three ways you might use the Miden compiler:


1. As an executable (via `midenc`)
2. As a library (most likely via the `midenc-compile` and `midenc-hir` crates) 
3. As a Cargo extension (via `cargo miden`)

Each of these is described in the following chapters, we hope you find this book useful!
