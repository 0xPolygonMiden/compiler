/// The criteria for this succeeding is:

/// 0. There must be no copies required and at least one operand expected
/// 1. The value expected on top of the stack should be one of:
///   * On top, but the next element expected behind it is off-by-one. In which case we search for
///     the element that goes there, move it up, and swap.
///   * Not on top, but in a cycle with another misplaced operand, such that moving the latter to
///     the top of the stack and swapping it with the expected top operand puts them both into place
///   * Not on top, but once moved to the top, is a valid solution already
///
/// If after performing those steps, the stack is in the correct order,
/// the tactic was successful, otherwise the operand ordering cannot be
/// solved with this tactic (alone anyway).
