/// The criteria for this succeeding is:
///
/// 0. There must be no copies required and at least two operands expected
/// 1. The value on top of the stack should either be:
///   * Evicted, and the value at the back of the constrained stack is an expected operand, thus
///     swapping them accomplishes both goals at once
///   * Swapped into its expected position, putting an operand at the top which is in position, can
///     be moved into position, or is to be evicted.
///
/// If after performing those steps, the stack is in the correct order,
/// the tactic was successful, otherwise the operand ordering cannot be
/// solved with this tactic (alone anyway).
