/// This tactic is applied if moving the top value down the
/// stack presents an opportunity for a subsequent swap to
/// fix the order of the stack.
///
/// The criteria for this succeeding is:
///
/// 0. There must be no copies required, and at least two operands expected
/// 1. The value on top of the stack should either be
/// evicted, or should be moved to its expected
/// position, and if applicable, past any remaining
/// operands which belong before it in the final
/// ordering
/// 2. After moving the value on top, one of the following
/// is true:
///   * The stack is now ordered, and we're done
///   * The operand on top of the stack is out of place,
///   and the operand in its place is either:
///     1. Expected to be on top of the stack, so we can swap
///     2. Will be moved into place if we move the top of the
///        stack immediately past it, so we can move
///
/// If we apply these steps, and the stack ends up in the
/// desired order, then this tactic was successful.
