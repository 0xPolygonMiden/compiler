/// The [OperandMovementConstraintSolver] is used to produce a solution to the following problem:
///
/// An instruction is being emitted which requires some specific set of operands, in a particular
/// order. These operands are known to be on the operand stack, but their usage is constrained by a
/// rule that determines whether a specific use of an operand can consume the operand, or must copy
/// it and consume the copy. Furthermore, the operands on the stack are not guaranteed to be in the
/// desired order, so we must also move operands into position while operating within the bounds of
/// the move/copy constraints.
///
/// Complicating matters further, a naive approach to solving this problem will produce a lot of
/// unnecessary stack manipulation instructions in the emitted code. We would like the code we emit
/// to match what a human might write if facing the same set of constraints. As a result, we are
/// looking for a solution to this problem that is also the "smallest" solution, i.e. the least
/// expensive solution in terms of cycle count.
///
/// ## Implementation
///
/// With that context in mind, what we have here is a non-trivial optimization problem. If we could
/// treat the operand stack as an array, and didn't have to worry about copies, we could solve this
/// using a standard minimum-swap solution, but neither of those are true here. The copy constraint,
/// when present, means that even if the stack is in the exact order we need, we must still find a
/// way to copy the operands we are required to copy, move the ones we are required to consume, and
/// do so in such a way that getting them into the required order on top of the stack takes the
/// minimum number of steps.
///
/// Even this would be relatively straightforward, but an additional problem is that the MASM
/// instruction set does not provide us a way to swap two operands at arbitrary positions on the
/// stack. We are forced to move operands to the top of the stack before we can move them elsewhere
/// (either by swapping them with the current operand on top of the stack, or by moving the operand
/// up to the top, shifting all the remaining operands on the stack down by one). However, moving a
/// value up/down the stack also has the effect of shifting other values on the stack, which may
/// shift them in to, or out of, position.
///
/// Long story short, all of this must be taken into consideration at once, which is extremely
/// difficult to express in a way that is readable/maintainable, but also debuggable if something
/// goes wrong.
///
/// To address these concerns, the [OperandMovementConstraintSolver] is architected as follows:
///
/// We expect to receive as input to the solver:
///
/// * The set of expected operand values
/// * The set of move/copy constraints corresponding to each of the expected operands
/// * The current state of the operand stack at this point in the program
///
/// The solver produces one of three possible outcomes:
///
/// * `Ok(solution)`, where `solution` is a vector of actions the code generator must take to get
///   the operands into place correctly
/// * `Err(AlreadySolved)`, indicating that the solver is not needed, and the stack is usable as-is
/// * `Err(_)`, indicating an unrecoverable error that prevented the solver from finding a solution
///   with the given inputs
///
/// When the solver is constructed, it performs the following steps:
///
/// 1. Identify and rename aliased values to make them unique (i.e. multiple uses of the same value
///    will be uniqued)
/// 2. Determine if any expected operands require copying (if so, then the solver is always
///    required)
/// 3. Determine if the solver is required for the given inputs, and if not, return
///    `Err(AlreadySolved)`
///
/// When the solver is run, it attempts to find an optimal solution using the following algorithm:
///
/// 1. Pick a tactic to try and produce a solution for the given set of constraints.
/// 2. If the tactic failed, go back to step 1.
/// 3. If the tactic succeeded, take the best solution between the one we just produced, and the
///    last one produced (if applicable).
/// 4. If we have optimization fuel remaining, go back to step 1 and see if we can find a better
///    solution.
/// 5. If we have a solution, and either run out of optimization fuel, or tactics to try, then that
///    solution is returned.
/// 6. If we haven't found a solution, then return an error
