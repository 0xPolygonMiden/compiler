/// Derivation of a MASM component from an HIR world
///
/// A world is not a component, and the difference is what this impl exists to handle: a
/// component's body holds modules, interfaces and functions, while a world's body holds
/// *components* as well. Handing a world's own operation to `MasmComponentBuilder`, which walks a
/// component body, therefore panics the moment it meets the first `builtin.component`.
///
/// So the shape of the world decides how it is lowered:
///
/// - A world holding **no** component is treated as one logical component whose body is the
///   world's, which is what it has always meant here. This is the shape `frontend/masm`'s
///   disassembler produces — it defines modules directly on the world — so it is a live path.
/// - A world holding **one** component is lowered by lowering that component, because a
///   component is what a Miden package is rooted at and carries the identity it is rooted at.
///   Delegating rather than reimplementing is deliberate: the result is then the same
///   [`MasmComponent`] the equivalent standalone `builtin.component` produces, by construction
///   rather than by two implementations agreeing.
/// - A world holding **more than one** component is reported, and that limitation is external to
///   this crate — see `too_many_components`.
///
/// # Top-level items beside the component are normal, and are not an error
///
/// A world is not "a component, optionally". It may hold a component — the current codegen unit —
/// **plus any number of sibling interfaces and modules**, which are either
///
/// - *external dependencies represented in the IR*, which hold declarations only and contribute
///   nothing to the generated Miden Assembly, or
/// - *supporting modules*, which are translated 1:1 to Miden Assembly modules and linked into the
///   final assembly as ad-hoc modules.
///
/// A world holding a single component is only the *happy path*, and only for the Rust frontend,
/// which compiles to one Wasm component and translates it to one HIR component. Other frontends,
/// the MASM one included, legitimately produce several top-level items. **Neither kind of sibling
/// may fail a build.**
///
/// The first kind is recognized by `is_declaration_only` and ignored, silently, because that is
/// exactly what it is worth. The second is translated beside the component, by handing it to the
/// same `MasmComponentBuilder` the component is lowered by — which is what makes it share the
/// component's `LinkInfo` rather than lay a layout of its own over it.
///
/// The one shape left out is a top-level module that **owns memory**, i.e. declares a global
/// variable or a data segment; see `report_siblings_that_own_memory` for the rule and why it is
/// where the line falls.
///
/// Every producer hands this impl a *top-level* world: the world a whole-`builtin.world` `.hir`
/// file parses to, the world `midenc_hir::parse` anchors any other top-level operation at, the
/// world the Wasm frontend builds, and the one `frontend/masm`'s disassembler builds.

///   not get past this. That is deliberately stricter than lowering now requires — a nested module
///   can be lowered, but a top-level sibling holding one still has no parent component to own
///   whatever memory that nesting hides, and this predicate cannot see that far.
/// - **A declared global counts, not just a defined one.** [`Linker::link`] skips declarations
///   when building the layout, so this is strictly stricter than the overlay hazard requires. It
///   is the right side to err on: a declaration whose definition is elsewhere is absent from the
